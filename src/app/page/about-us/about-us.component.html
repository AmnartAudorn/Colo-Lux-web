          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>
            The data collected currently shows that there are approximately 3
            million new cases of colorectal cancer patients annually. We foresee
            an issue in the future and are actively seeking opportunities to
            address the cancer problem. We have qualified doctors specialized in
            this field who are here to provide direct treatment for cancer
            patients. In the early stages, colorectal cancer can be treated and
            cured. However, if detected at an advanced stage or diagnosed late,
            it becomes challenging to cure. We are determined to study and
            progress in proactive approaches to screen individuals at risk of
            cancer.Cololux is a platform established by gastrointestinal specialists from a leading university in Thailand. Because of their expertise in the gastrointestinal tract, our physicians have received preliminary level certification from the Asian region, which is top-tier. Therefore, you
            can trust that our website maintains world-class quality. We exist to ensure that you receive the best possible treatment. You can contact us immediately for faster
            treatment.
